# Shopping App

This application tracks a house's products to buy.
Just like a hand-made shopping list that your parent's give to you.

## Description

This application started as a final project for a bootcamp which I attended. Now this project became a training grounds for me to apply what I've learned throughout courses and camps and on my own.

## Screenshots

Until the UI looks good enough to share there will be no screenshots added. :)

## Features - what does this do?

For starters, we have categories, products, users and shopping lists.

### Users

- Can have multiple shopping lists
- Can add/remove/update products to their shopping lists
- Can share their lists to users which they can edit

When you set a shopping list as `shopping now` edits can only be done by the user who is shopping.
